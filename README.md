# Assignment:
Weâ€™d like you to build a simple shopping cart experience that includes a small set
of features and functions on both desktop and mobile. We are not concerned with completeness
but rather code quality and thoughtfulness in the code.
Please reach out with any clarifying questions!
## Technical Requirements
* Your Shopping cart should have a frontend, backend, and database (We want to see
data being persisted, and not stored in local storage or a JSON file)
* Your entire application should be dockerized
* Include Unit tests
* Include a detailed README that includes instructions on how to launch your dockerized
application.
** There should not be any global dependency requirements other than Docker.
** Please test it out on a clean clone of your repo with all the relevant Docker
containers deleted; we will not debug the app if it doesn't work out of the box

## Feature Requirements
* The user should:
    * see an empty cart message on their first interaction with the page
    * be able to add items to their cart
    * See an updated list of cart items upon adding items to their cart
    * be able to change the quantity of each cart item in their cart
    * see a cart summary or totals block on the page

## Considerations
* This is your chance to show us your skills and exploit your strengths. If you are a
back-end focused programmer, you should focus more of your time there and
vice-versa.
Note:
* If invited for an onsite interview, be prepared to demo your application and talk through
your design decisions.
